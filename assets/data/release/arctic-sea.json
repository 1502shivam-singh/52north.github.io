If not, surround description with SensorML element\r\n*  Fix coordinate switching: With Hibernat 5.4 and the used Geolatte, the CoordianteSequence of a Geometry from the Database is of type PackedPositionSequence which returns copies of the coordinates. Therefore, the apply()  method with filter does not change the coordinate axis which is fixed by this.\r\n* Allow minoccurrence of zero (i.e. optional inputs) in `org.n52.shetland.ogc.wps.description.impl.AbstractProcessInputDescription.java`\r\n* Handle missing/wrong service and/or version for all operations\r\n* Add NoSuchJob and ResultNotReady exceptions for WPS 2.0 implementations\r\n* Differentiate between no identifier param and empty identifer param value for DescribeProcess requests\r\n* Use LocaleHelper.decode() instead of new Locale() regardless of whether the requested language is 2 or 3 coded.\r\n* Add support for getting name from shortname identification element fo SensorML encoded procedure descriptions.\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n* None\r\n\r\nSee [here](https://github.com/52North/arctic-sea/compare/v5.2.0...v5.3.0) for the complete commit log."}
