release contains several bug fixes, improvements and a few new features. See the [Change log](https://github.com/52North/Ilwis3Downloads/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more details. The ILWIS 3.8 Visualization reference document is available [here](http://52north.org/files/ilwis/ILWIS_3.8_Map_Visualization.pdf).\r\n\r\n## Changes in 3.8.5:\r\nThe following bugs were solved, some new features were added:\r\n\r\n- Map Window selections: added the option to select polygons (previously only points and segments could be selected)\r\n- Added ellipsoidal Plate Carree coordinate system\r\n- Table Join operation: added the missing option to join a column of type Coord, making it possible to e.g. join the coordinates of a pointmap into its attribute table\r\n- Space Time Cube: added the 3D wind-rose option; added XT, XY, YT lines\r\n- Applications: added Parallax Correction of clouds for MSG images (under Image Processing), and Probability Density raster generation (frmprobabilitydensity)\r\n- Improved the compatibility on computers with Intel HD Graphics or combo-graphics-hardware (potential crashes when opening a Map Window). Therefore the \"Software Rendering\" option in the ILWIS Preferences can be disabled for those who enabled it as a workaround.\r\n- Restored the Epipolar Stereopair functionality (both creation and viewing in the stereoscope window)\r\n- Restored the Import->ILWIS->TIFF functionality (message DATUM.DEF was not found)\r\n- Many stability and usability improvements in the Import functionality for both maps and tables, and recognition of more projections (all Import methods, including ILWIS, GDAL and PostgreSQL)\r\n- Stability improvements in the Export functionality (both ILWIS and GDAL)\r\n- Calling external commands works again (message Exit Code 1)\r\n- Restored the rectangle-based Zoom-Out functionality\r\n- Restored the No-Zoom option for raster images that maps each raster pixel to an on-screen pixel. Use the \"Global Tools->Geometry->GeoReference\" tool and select the georeference that corresponds to the raster image, in order to display it unprojected.\r\n- MapGlue now allows gluing large images\r\n- Improved the table Window summary statistics for boolean columns and for selected records\r\n- Improved the interactive slicing application\r\n- Solved the problem whereby the Representation Editor would show a wrong color ramp in the preview\r\n- Solved potential crashes and wrong results in the vector operations Union and Intersect\r\n- Solved \"vector<T> too long\" error when opening corrupted polygon maps\r\n- Improvements in per-class hatching and transparency for polygon layers\r\n- Solve potential crashes when opening \"Use As\" data\r\n- Now the Color Composite application creates 24 bits files when this option is selected (previously it was always 8 bits)\r\n- Open Street Map: corrected the zoom level making the labels readable, and solved potential deadlocks and crashes. Known issue: OSM may not show in 3D-view, depending on the viewing angle.\r\n- DEM Hydro-Processing functions: solved potential \"vector <T> too long\" and \"Find Error\" problems, and the menu is now arranged in the recommended workflow order.\r\n- Maplist Statistics now work again: solved the \"Encountered an improper argument\" error\r\n- Solved inconsistent behavior in iff statement when one of the parameters is undef (?): iff (a,b,?) is now the same as iff(not a,?,b)\r\n- Solved crashes or empty results in copying a map to the clipboard when using WMS and Open Street Map, or when using Software Rendering\r\n- Solved crashes and inconsistent behavior in the Cross Section, Hovmoeller and Track Profile tools\r\n- Solved many random crashes in ILWIS\r\n\r\n## Files\r\nYou can download the big one file download or the splitted version.\r\n\r\nPlease ignore the source code downloads here. The source code can be downloaded from this source:\r\n\r\nhttps://svn.52north.org/svn/ilwis/Ilwis3/"}
